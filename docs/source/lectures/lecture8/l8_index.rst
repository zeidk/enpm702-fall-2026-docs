L8: OOP Basics
====================

Overview
--------

This lecture introduces the foundations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. We begin with the core principles -- encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism -- then explore how classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. The lecture walks through the full development cycle: requirement analysis, modeling with UML, and implementation using modern C++ features. Students will learn to define classes with proper encapsulation (access specifiers), write accessors and mutators with ``const``-correctness, construct objects using default constructors, parameterized constructors, and member initializer lists, and work with the ``this`` pointer and ``static`` members. Modern C++ idioms such as ``std::string_view``, ``std::optional``, ``[[nodiscard]]``, and ``noexcept`` are integrated throughout.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. Understand the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism).
2. Define and implement classes with proper encapsulation using access specifiers.
3. Create constructors (default and parameterized) with member initializer lists.
4. Implement accessors and mutators with proper ``const``-correctness.
5. Apply modern C++ features including ``std::string_view``, ``std::optional``, ``[[nodiscard]]``, and ``noexcept``.
6. Understand the ``this`` pointer and how objects share methods.
7. Use ``static`` data members and ``static`` member functions.

Next Steps
----------

In **Lecture 9: OOP Advanced**, we will explore advanced object-oriented programming topics including inheritance, composition, aggregation, polymorphism with virtual functions, and operator overloading. These concepts build directly on the class design fundamentals covered in this lecture.
